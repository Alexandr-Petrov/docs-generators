about: |
  Senior DevOps / Cloud / Platform Engineer with 6+ years of experience operating production systems in EU environments, fluent in English and German and working directly with distributed international teams.

  I specialize in AWS infrastructure, Kubernetes platforms, CI/CD automation, and production reliability. My focus is on building real-time, observable, and predictable systems, not just delivering features.

  With a strong software engineering background, I bridge development and operations by designing operable, maintainable platforms. I deliver end-to-end: from architecture and infrastructure as code to monitoring, documentation, and structured handover to operating teams.

  Available for remote contracts. Working CET (UTC+1) hours.
