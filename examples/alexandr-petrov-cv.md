about: |
  I am a engineer with over 6 years of experience, specializing in DevOps and software development.
  In most of my projects, I initially took on backend or full-stack roles, building systems from the ground up. Over time, as projects evolved, I naturally transitioned into DevOps responsibilities.
  Today I can independently deliver robust software products end-to-end: choosing the right technologies, designing scalable architectures, and establishing modern CI/CD, monitoring, and maintenance processes.
